WebHelpers TODO
===============

WebHelpers 1.x is in a soft feature freeze, so only bugfixes and small changes
are likely to be made in the foreseeable future.

See also the bug list at http://bigbucket.org/bbangert/webhelpers .

``webhelpers.html.grid`` needs better docs. The API could maybe use some
improvement too.

The "unfinished" directory in the WebHelpers source distribution contains
potential future helpers which are not finished enough for release. These are
not installed by the installer; they are available only in the source tarball.

Port to Python 3.

Too many strip_tags / sanitize / bleach functions.

grid_demo: usage message shows "__main__" rather than package.module.
