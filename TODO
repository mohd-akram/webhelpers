WebHelpers TODO
===============

See also the bug list at http://bigbucket.org/bbangert/webhelpers .

``webhelpers.text.convert_misc_characters`` fails tests. It's producing
incorrect output.  This affects ``remove_formatting`` too.

``webhelpers.html.grid`` needs some API changes to make a table from a list of
lists and from a dict. Some arguments will be changing also.
